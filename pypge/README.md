In this folder I will be playing with Tony Worm's symbolic regression algorithm.

This is a beautiful algorithm that replaces the genetic algorithm of Eureqa
(may she die a thousand deaths) with a grammar based exploration of forms.

Resources on this program can be found in the original paper and also in a
[Github book](http://verdverm.github.io/sr/) Tony Worm is writing.

The true power of symbolic regression is the seemingly magical ability to both
attain unlimited flexibility without losing interpretibility. Generally in
machine learning there is a tradeoff between these two. Of course, SR, like all
non-parametric methods, will require a lot of data to do a good job (no free
lunch).
